Conclusion
=====

The developed system demonstrated a strong predictive performance, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 86% across the three core output features—validation equipment (~92.5%), sampling rate (~80%), and validation procedure (~85%). These results underline the model’s capability to support the creation of control plans in a reliable and data-driven manner.

Overall, the implementation of this predictive system led to significant improvements in the control plan creation process. Most notably, it drastically reduced the time required to develop such plans and minimized the risk of human error. Additionally, it lowered the need for human resources in the decision-making phase and as a result increased the standardization of the process. Thanks to its data-driven architecture, the system also enables continuous self-improvement through ongoing re-training with new data—ensuring it remains robust and relevant in future use cases.
