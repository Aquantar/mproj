Introduction
============

The idea emerged from several brainstorming sessions with Jopp, which focused on identifying potential improvements in the companyâ€™s workflows and incorporating artificial intelligence in the process.After abandoning the initial task of automating FMEA reports, the idea emerged to work on a way to predict values for control plans that are being filled out manually currently.
After receiving test data from Jopp, we were able to conduct initial tests, which yielded promising results. This allowed us to begin developing a decision support system to assist Jopp in creating these control plans.
