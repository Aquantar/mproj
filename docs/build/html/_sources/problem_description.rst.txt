Problem Formulation
=====

Introduction
----------------

During the inception of a FMEA file for a new component to be manufactured at Jopp Group, a control plan which defines the validation workflow for each characteristic of that component is designed.
The purpose of this control plan is to determine the following for each characteristic of that component in order to assure a consistent output quality: the testing equipment to be used, the optimal sampling rate to be applied, as well as the specific validation procedure to be followed.

Status Quo
----------------

Historically, the process described above is performed by human experts in an audit when a new component is designed at Jopp. During this process, data regarding each component characteristic is viewed in detail and vast experience accumulated over 
time is applied to select correct values during control plan creation. This has lead to a large set of data over multiple years, which documents a multitude of characteristics across many components in conjunction with their selected values regarding the correct testing equipment, optimal sampling rate, and validation procedure.

Problem
----------------

While the above process has been applied for a long time at Jopp, it has proven to be a time-consuming task which is also prone to human error. During our initial analysis conducted together with Jopp, it has been determined that this area of operations
has a large potential for improvement by lowering the human factor in order to reduce time consumption as well as reduce error rates.
